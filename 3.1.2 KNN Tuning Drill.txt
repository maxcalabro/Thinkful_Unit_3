DRILL:

Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

You could use to see how the things people spend their money on may affect the likelihood that theyâ€™ll pay their card off on time. There may be groups of people with similar spending habits that exhibit similar behavior. I would run a KNN with theses four variables (normalized), along with the results of the training data: whether they paid their card on time. The boundaries may be complex in this four-dimensional space, so KNN could be effective in find which customers the test case is most similar.
